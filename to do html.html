        To-do lists offer a way to increase productivity, stopping you from
        forgetting things, helps prioritise tasks, manage tasks effectively, use
        time wisely and improve time management as well as workflow.
      </p>
      <!-- <br /> -->
      <p class="p2">
        By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down
        all in one place so you don't forget anything important. And by
        prioritizing tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do them, so that
        you can tell what needs your immediate attention, and what you can leave
        until later.
